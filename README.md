# DataMinr
Python program that does all the data mining for you!

You will need to create some accounts and change the code a bit if you want the program to work.
Here are the links to do so.

(May just create an account for ubiquitous use. We will see, there are benefits to using your own account
(friends of friends) but it would be easy for distribution if there was a single account)



USE AT YOUR OWN RISK, WE ARE NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR ANY TROUBLE THAT SHOULD COME TO YOU FROM USING
THIS PROGRAM.

(As far as I am aware nothing here is illegal as it is all publically available info but still)
